Walking an Application

Some browser based tools:
	View Source
	Inspector
	Debugger
	Network

Checking the source code can provide insight of how the page works, pay close attention
to comments, links, anything not displayed on the surface.

Check for things such as linked filed (js, css, any assets) this may lead you to find
vulnerabilities in directory listing.

Website are built based on frameworks that include certain features and save time in
development. When searching the source code, try to look for clues that help you 
identify this framework; this may tell you if the site is out of date, or help you
look for vulnerabilities.

Developer Tools - Inspector

Page source does not always show what is being displayed on the page as the page changes
with user interaction, the Inspector tool shows as what on the screen live. You can change
everything here but once you reload it will go back to normal

	*display: block; (change this to get rid of the paywall)

Developer Tools - Debugger

The Debugger allows us to view JS code, it is useful to gather information and understanding
how the website works. It is called Sources in Google Chrome. So you will notice that some
JS files all written all in one line and are difficult to read, this is done both to
remove formatting and make the file lighter and so that it can't be copied easily by others.
You can use the Pretty Print option at the bottom of the text view, it looks like this
"{ }". This will return some readability. Just like you can in other programming 
languages, you can add breakpoints in this debugger which will stop the execution of the
code upon refreshing the website.

Developer Tools - Network

The Network tool allows us to see all the external requests that the site is making, as
well as what sites it connects to and some files.
