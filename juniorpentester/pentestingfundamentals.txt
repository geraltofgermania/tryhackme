Pentesting Fundamentals

PenTesting is VEReYYYYY important :(

White Hats: "The good guys," they work within the law and for the benefit of others.
Grey Hatw: Not always respect the law or follow ethical standards.
Black Hats: They perform criminal activiy.

Rules of Engagement (ROE):
	
	Permission: Legal document that gives explicit permission for the test to be carried
	out.
	Test Scope: Notes the targets (ex. servers, applications, etc) which may or may not
	include the whole network.
	Rules: Dictates what techniques are allowed; for example, phishing may not be
	allowed but Man In The Middle may be.

Penetration Testing Methodologies

General Methodology Steps:
	1. Information Gathering: Involves collecting as much info as possible about a target
	or organization, for example open source intelligence (OSINT) and reasearch
	2. Enumeration/Scanning: This stage involves discovering applications and services
	running on the systems. For example, finding a web server that may be potentially
	vurnerable.
	3. Exploitation: This stage involves leveraging vulnerabilites discovered on a system
	or application. This stage can involve the use of public exploits or explointing
	application logic.
	4. Priviledge Escalation: Once you have exploited the system/app (known as the foothold)
	this stage is an attempt to expand your access to the system. You can escalate horizontally,
	that is switching to another user of the same priviledge level; or vertically,
	switching to another user of a higher priviledge i.e. an admin.
	5. Post Exploitation: This stage involves a few substages:
		1. What other hosts can be targeted (pivoting)
		2. What additional information can we gather from the host now that we are
		a priviledged user.
		3. Covering your tracks
		4. Reporting

Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM): provides a detailed framework of
testing strategies for systems, software, applications, communications, and the human aspect
of cybersecurity.

Open Web Application SEcurity Project (OWASP) framework is a community driven and frequently
updated framework used solely to test the security of web applications and services. Reports
of the top ten vulnerabilities a web application may have, the testing and approach, and remediation

NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a popular framework used to improve an organisation's
cybersecurity standards. The framework provides guidelines on security controls and benchmarks
for success for organisation from critical infrastrcure (power plants, etc.) to commercial
	**NIST framework is estimated to be used by 50% of American organisations by 2020
	**Framework does not include cloud computing at the time of writing.

National Cyber Security Center Cyber Assesment Framework (NCSC CAF) is an extensive framework
of 14 principles used to assess the risk of various cuber threats and an organisations's
defenses against them. The framework focues on organisations that perform "vital services and activities"
The framework focuses and assesses the following topics: Data security, system security,
identity and access control, resiliency, monitoring, response and recovery planning.

Black Box, White Box, Grey Box Penetration Testing

There are three levels of scopes when testing an application or service; it is your
understanding of the target that determine the level of testing performed.

Black Box Testing: the tester is not given any info in the workrings of the service being
tested. The tester acts as a regular user and no knowledge of programming is necessary. This
type of testing significantly increases the amount of time spend in the information gathering
and enumeration stages to understand the attack surface of the target.

Grey Box: Partial knowledge; testing is a mix between black and white box testing. This is
the most common kind of testing. Still, the tester interacts with the target as if it were
a black box scenario and using his knowledge solves issues as they appear. This testing type
saves time and is used for extremely well hardened attack surfaces.

White Box: The tester is a developer with full knowledge of the app and its logic. The tester
will be testing internal components of the application such as functions to make sure they
work properly and within a reasonable time period. Very time consuming. Guarantees that the
entire attack surface can be validated.
