Principles of Security

The CIA triad model: extremly popular due to long history (1998), notes that security
does not end at cybersecurity but also includes filing, record storage, etc. A
policy must meet all three points in order to be effective, think of the fire triangle
for example.

Confidentiality: is the protection of data from unauthorized access and misuse.
To provide confidentiality is to protect this data from parties that it's not intended
for. For example, ensuring that employee records can only he accessed by HR and not
anyone else.

Integrity: Ensuring that information remains accurate and consistent unless authorized
changes are made. Integrity is where inforation remains unchanges during storage, transmission
and usage not invonling edits. Steps must be taken to ensure data cannot be altered
by unauthorized people.

Availability: In order for data to be useful, it must be available when the user needs
it. Such is the main concern of the CIA triad. When systems are unavailable, it offen
results in damages to the orginisation's reputation and finances. Good availability
can be achieved via some simple steps: having good, well tested hardware, having redundant
technology and services in case of failure of the primary, and implementing good security
protocols to protect services from attacks.

Principles of Priviledges

Privilegded Identity Management (PIM): is used to translate an user's role within an organization
to an access role in a system.

Priviledged Access Management (PAM): is the management of the priviledges a system's
access role has, among other things such as password management, auditing policies,
and reducing the attack surface of a system's face.

Security Models Continued

According to a security model, any system or piece of technology storing information
is called an information system.

Bell-La Padula Model "No write down, no read up"
	This model is popular in gov organizations and military as its member go through
	a vetting process and are assumed to be trustworthy. This model achieves confidentiality
	

Biba Model "No write up, no read down"
	This model is used to maintain integrity in which an user can only write changes
	at or bellow their level, and only read the objects created by users above their
	level.

Threat Modelling & Incident Response

Threat Modelling is the process of reviewing, improving, and testing the security protocols
in place in an organization's technology infrastructure and services.

Simple Principles are applied:
	Preparation
	Identification
	Mitigation
	Review

Threat modeling however, is a complex process. An effective model includes: threat intelligence,
asset identification, mitigation capabilities, and risk assessment.

To help with this there are frameworks such as STRIDE (Spoofing identity, Tampering
with data, Repudiation Threats, Information disclousure, Denial of Service, and Elevation
of privileges) and PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis). STRIDE
developed in 1999 by Microsoft still remains relevant, it is outlined bellow.

Spoofing: This principle requires you to authenticate requests and users accessing a
system. Spoofing involves a malicious party falsely identifying itself as another.
Access keys, such as API keys, or signatures via encryption help remediate that threat.

Tampering: Provide anti-tampering measures to keep data integral and accurate.

Repudiation: This principle dictates the use of services such as logging of activity
for a system or application to track. A service that provides proof of the integrity
and origin of data.

Information Disclosure: Systems must be configured to ensure that only information relevant
to the owner is shown.

Denial of Service: Applications and services use up system resources, these two things
should have measures in place so that the abuse of the service won't bring the whole
system down.

Escalation of Priviledges: Worst case scenario, the user has been able to escalate 
privileges to those of an administrator. This often leads to further exploitation or
information disclousure.

A breach of security is known as an incident and actions taken to resolve and remediate
the threat are known as incident response (IR) and it is a whole career field.

Incidents are rated using a scale of urgency and impact, the former is related to the
type of threat and the latter to its impact on business ops.

Incidents are repsonded to by Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) who
often follow six stages if IR:

	Preparation: do we have the resources and plans to deal with the incident
	
	Identification: has the threat and its author been correclty identified
	
	Containment: can the threat be contained to prevent other systems or users
	from being impacted.
	
	Eradication: Remove the active threat
	
	Recovery: Perform a full review of the impacted systems to return to usual ops
	
	Lessons Learned: What can be learned from the incident? The cause and how to
	avoid it.
