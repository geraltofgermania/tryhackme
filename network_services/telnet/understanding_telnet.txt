Understanding Telnet 

Telnet is an application layer protocol which allows you, with the use of a telnet client, to connect to and excecute commands on a remote machine hosting 
a telnet server.

Once the connection has been established the client acts as a terminal that executes the remote commands on the Telnet server.

Replacement

Telnet sends all commands and instruction in plain text and has no specific security mechanism. For most applications it is being replaced by SSH.

How does Telnet Work

You can connect to a Telnet server using the "telnet" command. After which you can execute commands in the Telnet prompt. Use the following syntax to connect
to a Telnet server:
	>>> telnet <ip> <port>

Enumerating Telnet

We start the same way we usually do, using nmap to perform a port scan, after this we can evaluate where to go. As with SMB the best way to exploit a Telnet
server is by finding and using misconfigurations.

Let's perform an nmap scan. See Telnet in Network Protocols 1, Tryhackme for the results.
