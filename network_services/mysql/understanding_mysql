Understanding MySql

In its simplest definition, MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) based on Structured Query Language (SQL).
This is a lot of acronyms, let's break it down a bit.

Database:

A data is simply a persistent, organized collection of structured data.

RDBMS

A software or service used to create and manage databases based on a relational model. The word relational means that the data
stored in the dataset is organized as tables. Every table related in some way to each other's "primary key" or other "key"
factors. This is very well explained in this article: https://www.ibm.com/topics/relational-databases

SQL

MySQL is just the brandname for one of the most popular RDBMSs software implementations. As we know MySQL uses a client-server
. But how do the client and server communicate. They use a language, specifically called Structured Query Language (SQL).

Many other products such as PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL server, have the word SQL in them, meaning that the product also uses the
syntax of Structured Query Language (SQL).

How does MySQL work?

MySQL as a Relational Database Management System is made up of the server and the utility programs that help in the administration
of MySQL databases. 

The server handles all database instructions such as creating, editing, and accessing data. It takes and handles all these requests
and communicates over MySQL protocol. The process can be broken down in stages.
	1. MySQL creates a database for storing and manipulating data, defining the relationship of each table.
	2. Clients make requests by making specific statments in SQL
	3. The server will respond to the client with the requested information.

What runs MySQL?

MySQL runs on various platforms from Linux to Windows. It is commonly used as a backend database for prominent websites and forms
an essesntial component of the LAMP stack which includes: Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
