Packets and Frames

Packets and frames are both small chuncks of information that when put together make
a bigger piece of information or message, however, they are not the same. Frames
are in layer 2, no information like IP is available. They are like envelopes that
when opened contain data packets. This process is called encapsulation.

At this point we can say that when we are talking about IP addresses, we'll be talking
about packets, and when talking about encapsulating information being stripped away
we'll be talking about frames.

Packets are an efficient way to share data across networked devices because data is
split up instead of being sent at once, avoiding bottlenecking. For example when you
load an image in your browser, the entire image is not loaded at once, rather packets
are put together one at a time.

Packets have different structures that depend upon the type of packet being sent. 
Networkig is full of standards and rules that dictate how the packet is handled on a
device. With the gigantic number of devices connected to the internet, standarization
is extremely important. Packets contain headers that come with information, a packet
that follows the Internet Protocol (IP) some important headers include: 

Header	Description
Time to Live:		This field sets an expiry timer for the packet to not clog up your network if it never manages to reach a host or escape!
Checksum:		This field provides integrity checking for protocols such as TCP/IP. If any data is changed, this value will be different from what was expected and therefore corrupt.
Source Address:		The IP address of the device that the packet is being sent from so that data knows where to return to.
Destination Address:	The device's IP address the packet is being sent to so that data knows where to travel next.
