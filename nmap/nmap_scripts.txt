Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) - Overview

The Nmap Scripting Engine or NSE for short is an incredibly powerfull addition to nmap, extending its functionallity condierably.
NSE scripts are written in the Lua programming language and can be used for variety of things: from scanning vulnerabilities to
executing exploits for them. NSE is particularly good for recon, but keep in mind how extensive the script library is.

There are many script categories, some of them include:
	-safe: won't affect the target
	-intrusive: not safe, likely to affect the target
	-vuln: scan for vulnerabilites
	-exploit: attempt to exploit a vulnerability
	-auth: attempt to bypass authentication for running services
	-brute: attempt to bruteforce credentials for running services
	-discovery: attempt to query running services for further information about networking
	NOTE: a more complete list can be found here https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html

Working with the NSE 

Just as seen before in or order to use NSE you use the command:
	>>> nmap --script <script name>
or
	>>> nmap --script=<script name>

In the same fashion we can give nmap a comma separated list of scripts:
	>>> nmap --script smb-enum-users,smb-enum-shares

Some scripts require arguments to be passed to them in order to work well, to do this we use the --script-args switch.
	>>> nmap --script <script name> --script-args <argument>,<argument>
An good example for --script-args is the http-put script that is used for uploading files with the http PUT method to a URL.
http-put takes two argumets: the target URL and the location of the file to upload.
	>>> nmap -p 80 --script http-put --script-args http-put.url='/dev/shell.php',http-put.file='./shell.php'

Note that the argumets are separated by commas with no spaces, and connected to their respective script with a dot.
	>>> --script-args <script name>.<script argument>

NOTE: A full list of scripts and their corresponding arguments can be found here: https://nmap.org/nsedoc/

If you need some help using a script nmap provides a help page for an individual script using the command:
	>>> nmap --script-help <script name>

Searching for Scripts

Now that we know how to use scripts we need to know how to find them. There are two ways to do this which should be used
in conjunction. The first one is using the link provided above and the second one is by looking at the scripts in your local
storage. For Linux this is at:
	/usr/share/nmap/scripts

In addition there are two ways to search for installed scripts. One is to look at the file /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db.
This file is an indexed text file which contain a list of the installed NSE scripts.

Nmap uses the aforementioned file to access and keep track of the scripts for NSE, you can also use grep on this file in
order to find what you are looking for.
	>>> grep 'ftp'/usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db
This will output the lines with 'ftp' in them. Remember you can use grep with script names and categories.

Another way is to use the command ls as such:
	>>> ls -l /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*ftp*
	NOTE: the asteriscs are wildcards that will return every file containing 'ftp' in the name regardless of what came
	before or is after.

Now what if we check the website and we are missing some scripts? Well you can usually fix this simple running
	>>> sudo apt update && sudo apt install nmap -y
but it can also be done manually using wget download tool
	>>> wget -O /usr/share/nmap/scripts/<script name>.nse https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/scripts/<script-name>.nse
	NOTE: -O is the output file
Then you have to run the command that updates script.db so that nmap can access the script:
	>>> nmap --script-updatedb
NOTE: If you know Lua you can add your own scripts to this directory and update the db file as seen above!

Firewall Avoidance

There is a common firewall configuration which is imperative that we know how to bypass. You typical Windows Host will have by
default the configuration to drop all ICMP packets, causing nmap to mark the host as not active or have you believe the host is
dead after performing a ping request. 

Thankfully nmap allows you to perform scans as if the host is alive, that is, skipping the ping before the scan. For this we use
the switch -Pn, which tells nmap to perform the scan without pinging.
	>>> nmap -Pn 192.168.0.2
Now there is a disadvantage to this, if the host is actually dead it will take nmap a long while to finish becuase it will still
attempt to check and double check each port specified.

NOTE: if you are already directly on the local network, nmap is also able to use ARP requests to determine host activity.

NOTE: Useful firewall evasion switches https://nmap.org/book/man-bypass-firewalls-ids.html

Here are some particularly useful ones.

	-f: splits packets into smaller pieces making them less likely to be dropped by a firewall.
	--mtu <number>: an alternative to -f, but you can specify the maximum unit size for the packets sent. This value must be a
	multiple of 8.
	--scan-delay <time>ms: used to add a delay between packets sent. Very useful when a network is unstable or avoiding
	triggering time-based firewalls or IDS.
	--badsum: generates an invalid checksum for packets, any real TCP/IP stack would drop this packet, however, a firewall
	may potentially respond automatically without checking the checksum of the packet confirming the presence of a firewall/
	IDS.
