remember that when you have several users and want to use hydra, create a file with all the loggins and use -L to run all these together

Check the JS code, not just the source code in HTML, look for vulnerabilities here.
For example in this code we find that if credentials are incorrect then:
 if (statusOrCookie === "Incorrect credentials") {
        loginStatus.textContent = "Incorrect Credentials"
        passwordBox.value=""
but otherwise:
else {
        Cookies.set("SessionToken",statusOrCookie)
        window.location = "/admin"
    }
}

So if we use the console to set theis cookie, we should be able to get a successful login.
in console: Cookies.set("SessionToken", "")

After doing this we find a ssh key in the page, with the username 'james'
so after putting this key in a file called 'james_id_rsa' we use ssh to john to prepare
to crack this file's password.

sudo /usr/bin/ssh2john james_id_rsa > forjohn.txt

After we do this we attempt to crack this password using john.

sudo john forjohn.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

after running john we have the following credentials: james: james13

now we gotta use ssh with the switch -i for identity file.

ssh -i james_rsa_id james@10.10.27.135 

NOTE it is important to have run chmod 600 filename as it is required for this type of ssh login

Once we login we find a note that mentions an automated build job which propably refers to a crontab
so we check it with cat /etc/crontab, when we do this we find that what it does is fetch the build from
a website and pipes it to bash, to exploit this we would need to somehow redirect the domain to our ip.

Then we will use SCP to copy linpeas and see if we can escalate our privileges

$ scp -i james_rsa_id  /usr/share/peass/linpeas/linpeas.sh james@10.10.27.135:/dev/shm

When we do this, we find that /etc/hosts is world-writeable meaning that we can replace the localhost IP
with our own and serve a malicious bash script.
