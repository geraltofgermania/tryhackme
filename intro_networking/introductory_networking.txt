The Open Systems Interconnection Model/OSI model

The OSI model is an standarized model which we use to demonstrate the theory
behind networking. In reality the TCP/IP model is used for networking, however,
the OSI model is easier to get an initial understanding.

7 Layers of the OSI model:
	Application
	Presentation
	Session
	Transport
	Network
	Data Link
	Physical

7. Application: this layer essentially provides networking options to programs
running on a computer through an interface for them to use in order to transmit 
data. When data passes through the application layer, it goes into the presentation
layer.

The application layer is not an application, instead it is a component withing
an application that control the communication method to other devices.

6. Presentation: Receives data from the application layer. Standarized the data
so that the receiving device is capable of understanding it. This layer formats
data into an standard format, handles any encryption, compression, or other
transformations necessary. Once done, data passes to the session layer. 

5. Session: Once data has been formatted and passed down to the session layer,
the session layer looks to see if it can set up a session with another computer
across the network, if it can't, then it returns an error and the process stops.
If it can, the session is established, and maintained by this layer. The session
layer works with the session layer of the receiving computer in order to synchronize
communications. The session layer is important because this session is unique
to the communication in question, this is how you can have two YouTube videos
playing at once in different tabs. When the session is properly established data
passes down to the transport layer.
