Networking Tools

This file contains a brief description of some networking tools that will prove useful in
our journey.

Ping

Ping is a very useful tool included out of the box in most OS's, it tests whether a connection
to a remote resource is possible. It operates on the Network layer of the OSI model and
the Internet layer of TCP/IP. It uses the ICMP protocol.

Basic syntax
	>>> ping <target>

Traceroute

Traceroute is a tool that allows you to map every step that your request takes to get to
the desired resources. The internet contains many servers networked to each other, and
it takes several intermediate steps to actually get to where you want to. Traceroute
shows you these steps. Traceroute operates using UDP on Unix-like OS's, this can be changed
with switches however.

Basic syntax:
	>>> traceroute <target>

NOTE: this tool is called 'tracert' on Windows, it operates using ICMP like ping.

WHOIS

Whois is a tool that allows you to search a domain's information such as IP address
and regristration details. Essentially domains (ex. google.com) translate into IP
addresses so that we don't have to remember a bunch of numbers every time we want to visit
a website. Whois gives you this address and more.

Basic syntax:
	>>> whois <target>

Dig

Before we get into dig let's recap on DNS

When you request a domain, there are several steps that go into translating the domain name
into an IP address:

	-Your computer checks its local cache to see if there it is stored there.
	-The request goes to the Recursive DNS server provided by your ISP whose details
	are stored in the router.
	-If the IP wasn't found in the previous step then the request is redirected to a
	root name server whose job is to keep track of domains that are next level down, that
	is Top Level Domain servers (.com .org etc.)
	-Then you are redirected to a TLD server that keeps track of the top level domain 
	requested such as .com.
	-The TLD server redirects you to the the Authoritative Name server, these store
	DNS records for domains directly, every domain has its information registered on an
	Authoritative Name server somewhere. They are the source of the information.
	-The information from the Authoritative name server is routed back to you.

All these steps happen automatically when you use a browser but you can do it manually with Dig.

Dig allows us to query recursive DNS servers of our choice for infomation about a domain. Dig is
an useful tool for network troubleshooting.

Basic syntax:
	>>>dig <@dns server ip> <target domain> <query type>
Example:
	>>>dig @8.8.8.8 google.com

Dig returns a lot of information, for now focus on the answer section which returns the desired
answer. Mainly IP address is what we are looking for. You can also see the TTL of the DNS record
that is now cashed in seconds.
