Encapsulation

As data passes down each layer of the OSI model more data is added to the start of the
transmission, for example, the Network layer would add headers which include source and
destination IP addresses, then when data passes to the Transport layer headers related
to the transmission protocol are added. The Data Link layer also adds a piece of information
at the end of the transmission which is used for checking for data loss or corruption. This trailing
piece of information adds a layer of security as data cannot be tampered with without
interrupting the chain. This process is referred to as encapsulation the process by which
data can be sent from one computer to another. 

See the image in this folder for a visual representation of this process.

Data is referred to as different things throughout this process, in layers 7, 6, 5 data
is simply called data. In layer 4, it then becomes datagrams or segments depending on
whether UDP or TCP was selected as the transmission protocol. Then, in layer 3 data is
referred to as packets. Packets get passed down to layer 2, Data Link, where they become
frames. And finally in layer 1, the physical layer, they are broken down into bits.

The receiving computer reverses this process. Starting at the physical layer all the way
up to application, stripping the added data as it goes in the process of de-encapsulation.

The processes of encapsulation and de-encapsulation are important because they provide
a standard methodology of sharing data between computers regardless of manufacturer, OS,
etc.
