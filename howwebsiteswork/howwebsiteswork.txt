How Websites Work

When you visit a website your browser makes a request to a web server for information about
the page you want to visit. The server responds with data your browser uses to show you the
website.

There are two major sides to websites:
Front End (Client Side): the way your browser renders a website
Back End (Server Side): a server that process your requests and returns a response.

Websites are made of 3 individual languages:
HTML HyperText Markup Language
CSS for Styling
JavaScript for functionality

JavaScript

JS is places within <script> tags or sourced using <script src='src.js'></script>
JS can be used to add functionality to the page as well as handle data and update the
user's view. It can be used with HTML elements to react to events such as onclick, etc.
