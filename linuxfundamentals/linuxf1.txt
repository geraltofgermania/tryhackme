Intro to shell operators

Symbol/ Description
Operator
&	This operator allows you to run commands in the background of your terminal.
&&	This operator allows you to combine multiple commands together in one line of your terminal.
>	This operator is a redirector - meaning that we can take the output from a command (such as using cat to output a file) and direct it elsewhere.
>>	This operator does the same function of the > operator but appends the output rather than replacing (meaning nothing is overwritten).
