Introduction to Researching

Researching is the most important skill a hacker can have since the knowledge base of the field
is massive. You can always expect to run into something you don't know and have to look up, regardless
of experience level. The ability to look something up and understand it is the most important
aspect to master.

Example Research Question

In this portion of Intro to Reasearching the question involved steganography, a technique involving

We can do this with a simple google search and from there continue to look for more answers through
searching and querying as needed.

NOTE: steghide is a tool for linux which allows us to hide and extract hidden files from other files.
