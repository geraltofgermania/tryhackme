Introduction to Researching

Researching is the most important skill a hacker can have since the knowledge base of the field
is massive. You can always expect to run into something you don't know and have to look up, regardless
of experience level. The ability to look something up and understand it is the most important
aspect to master.

Example Research Question

In this portion of Intro to Reasearching the question involved steganography, a technique involving
hiding files in other files. In order to get an understanding of what this is we must start reaseaching.
We can do this with a simple google search and from there continue to look for more answers through
searching and querying as needed.

NOTE: steghide is a tool for linux which allows us to hide and extract hidden files from other files.

Vulnerability Searching

When hacking, you'll come across software that can be exploited such as content management systems like
Ghost, Fuel CMS, Wordpress... In order to find exploits that already exitst in these services you can
consult sites such as:

	ExploitDB (searchsploit CLI): this site can be very useful because it often contains exploits
	that can be downloaded straight from the site and used.
	National Vulnerability Database NVD: Keeps record of CVEs whether or not there is an exploit
	publicly available.
	CVE Mitre (Common vulnerability and exposures)

Common vulnerabilites and exposures are titled in the following format: CVE-Year-IDnumner.
The year of the CVE is not when it is published, rather it is when it was discovered, so you could find
a CVE with the year 2019 that was released in 2020.
