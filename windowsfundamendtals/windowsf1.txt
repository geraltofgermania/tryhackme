Windows Fundamentals Part 1

Windows has a long history starting in 1985 all the way to the present day, some notable versions
are Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, and presently 11.

Windows is the leading OS in the market prompting it to be the main target of hacker and others.
There is also a Windows Server version.

The Windows File System

The file system used in new versions of windows is called the New Technology File System, NTFS,
older versions of the OS used FAT16/32 which stands for File Allocation Table, or also High Performance
File System, HPFS.

NTFS is knows as a journaling file system which means it is capable of restoring folders and files from
a log file, this function is not possible with FAT. NTFS addresses limitation of FAT:

Supports files larger than 4GB
Set specific permissions for files and folders
Folder and file compression
Encryption (Encryption File System of EFS)

In NTFS you can set permissions that grant or deny access to folders and files
The permissions are:

Full control
Modify
Read & Execute
List folder contents
Read
Write

How can you view the permissions for a file or folder?

Right-click the file or folder you want to check for permissions.
From the context menu, select Properties.
Within Properties, click on the Security tab.
In the Group or user names list, select the user, computer, or group whose permissions you want to view.

You can refer to Microsoft Documentation to get a better understanding of the NTFS permissions and Special
Permissions

Another feature of NTFS is Alternate Data Stream ADS, every file has at least one data stream and ADS allows
files to contain more than one data stream. Natively Windows explorer doesn't show ADS to the user but there
are third party executables that can be used to view these. Powershell allows you to view ADS for files.
From a security perspective malware writers have used ADS in order to hide data from the users, not all the
uses of ADS are malicious as there are identifiers written to ADS that detect when a file was downloaded from
the Internet for example. To learn more about ADS refer to https://blog.malwarebytes.com/101/2015/07/introduction-to-alternate-data-streams/
