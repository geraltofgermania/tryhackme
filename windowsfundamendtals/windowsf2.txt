Launch System Configuration by searching 'Msconfig' in the start menu. You will need local
administrator privileges

System configuration is used for advance troubleshooting and its main purpose is to help
diagnose start up issues.

It is composed of 5 tabs across the top:

General

In General we can choose what devices and services Windows will load on boot.
We have three options: NORMAL, DIAGNOSTIC, and SELECTIVE

Boot

In Boot we can choose various options for the operating system such as: No GUI Boot,
and we can see the drive and folder we boot from.

Services

In Services we can see all the services configured for the system regardless of status
(running or stopped). We can see their status as well here.

Startup

In the Startup tab you will be asked to use Task Manager to manage start up items.
(Start up items are those programs users install such as Steam or Spotify that start on boot.
This can be enabled and disabled from Task Manager(taskmgr). System Configuration is not a Startup
Manager.

Tools

The Tools tab lists many tools that can be used to further configure the system. You will
be provided a small description of what the tool does. There is also a box that shows the
path to the tool and the option to Launch it allowing you to open the tool from Msconfig.
